            <li>5cm (2″) piece galangal, peeled, roughly chopped </li>
            <li>5cm (2″) piece ginger, peeled, roughly chopped</li>

            <li>2 tsp ground cumin</li>
            <li>2 tsp ground coriander</li>
            <li>1 tsp sea salt</li>
    
        </ul>
   <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
             <li>
                For the rendang paste, soak the dried chillies in hot water for 10 minutes to soften. Drain (reserving the soaking liquid) and roughly chop the softened chillies. 
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Place the chillies and remaining rendang paste ingredients in a food processor and blend until smooth. Add 1-2 tablespoons of the chilli soaking water if the paste is too thick to blend.  Set aside.  
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Toast the desiccated coconut in a dry frying pan over medium-high heat until golden brown. Transfer to a bowl and set aside. 
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Place a large, heavy-based saucepan or non-stick wok over high heat. Add the vegetable oil and sear the beef, in batches, for 2-3 minutes each side or until evenly browned. Transfer the beef to a plate. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the same saucepan back over medium heat (there should be at least 1 tablespoon of oil and fat in the saucepan but if not, add a little vegetable oil) and add the star anise, cardamom pods and lemongrass.  Cook, stirring for a minute until fragrant.  Add rendang paste and cook for 2 minutes.  Stir through coconut milk, toasted coconut, palm sugar and fish sauce.  Add the seared beef and the makrut lime leaves.  Reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer for 2 hours, stirring every so often (add a little more water if the sauce becomes too thick). 
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the lid and use a large spoon to remove excess oil and fat from the top of the sauce. Simmer for a further 30 minutes, uncovered, or until the sauce is thick and gravy-like. Remove from heat. Remove the star anise. Top with finely sliced makrut lime leaves and serve with steamed rice.
            </li>
        </ol>
